# Data Scientist Roadmap

A bunch of tutorials could easily complete this roadmap, helping whoever wants to start learning stuff about data science.

For the moment, a lot is got on wikipedia(except for codes, always handmade). Any help's thus welcome!

## Rules

* Feel free to fork this repository and pull requests.
* Always comment your code.
* Please respect topology for filenames.
* There's one README for each directory.
* Also, could be great to share useful links or ressources in README files.
